// Saving this document with automatic formatting adds a line in between the note symbol in the `<sup>` element and the note text.
// This adds a space in between the symbol and the text in the final HTML.
// To preserve the lack of a space, save this file without formatting by pressing `Cmd+Shift+P` (in VS Code) and selecting `File: Save without formatting`.
